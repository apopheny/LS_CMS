# LS170 Lesson 1 - The Internet

------

## Summary

- The internet is a vast *network of networks*. It is comprised of both the *network infrastructure* itself (devices, routers, switches, cables, etc.) and the *protocols* that enable that infrastructure to function.
- Protocols are *systems of rules*. Network protocols are systems of rules governing the exchange or transmission of data over a network.
- Different types of protocol are concerned with different aspects of  network communication. It can be useful to think of these different  protocols as operating at particular 'layers' of the network.
- *Encapsulation* is a means by which protocols at different network layers can work together.
- Encapsulation is implemented through the use of *Protocol Data Units* (PDUs). The PDU of a protocol at one layer, becomes the data payload of the PDU of a protocol at a lower layer.
- The *physical network* is the tangible infrastructure that  transmits the electrical signals, light, and radio waves which carry  network communications.
- *Latency is a measure of delay*. It indicates the amount of time it takes for data to travel from one point to another.
- *Bandwidth is a measure of capacity*. It indicates the amount of data that can be transmitted in a set period of time.
- *Ethernet* is a set of standards and protocols that enables *communication between devices on a local network*.
- Ethernet uses a Protocol Data Unit called a Frame.
- Ethernet uses *MAC addressing* to identify devices connected to the local network.
- The *Internet Protocol* (IP) is the predominant protocol used for *inter-network communication*.
- There are two versions of IP currently in use: IPv4 and IPv6.
- The *Internet Protocol* uses a system of addressing (IP Addressing) to *direct data between one device and another across networks*.
- IP uses a Protocol Data Unit called a Packet.

## Question: What is the Internet?

## Evidence:

- A network can be as few as two computers connected with a CAT cable. A local area network (LAN) is a larger network with multiple computers  and devices connected together via a switch.
- A router/gateway allows communication **between** networks, including the gateways themselves as well as the switches and individual devices on each network.
- The internet can be thought of as the sum-total of these networks as well as the infrastructure that supports their communication.

## Answer: The internet is a network of networks

## Question: How do networks on the internet communicate with one another?

## Evidence:

- Due to the number of devices communicating with one another, it  would be easy for devices to send messages out of order, without knowing whether they were received, to the wrong party, on infrastructure that  was too congested to handle additional throughput.
- Communication involves **structure**: There must be a set of agreed-upon rules or conventions which define when to communicate, to whom, and in what way.
- Given the different types of communication performed by devices and  their applications, there must be different sets of rules for different  types of communication, and the current set must be agreed-upon.
- These sets of rules are protocols, and they include:
  - IP (internet protocol)
  - SMTP (e-mail)
  - UDP (user datagram protocol)
  - TCP (transmission control protocol)
  - TLS (transport layer security)
  - FTP (file transfer protocol)
  - HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol)
  - HTTPS (hypertext transfer protocol secure)
  - Ethernet (NIC-to-NIC)
  - DNS (domain name server)

## Answer: Internet communication is performed with protocols.

## Question: What are the layers involved in inter-network communication?

## Evidence:

* There are two models of the internet: 

* ![image-20220717192113659](C:\Users\cedou\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20220717192113659.png)

* The DoD/TCP model tends to be the dominant model, although adding the Physical layer beneath the Link layer tends to paint a more complete picture

  * The application layer is the data generated or processed by processes running on a client or host. Each process has its own port on the device: For instance, each tab in an internet browser utilizes its own port. Applications may call a process which utilizes internetwork communication, which moves it to the transport layer.
  * The transport layer utilizes a protocol (TCP/UDP) to begin to mobilize data across networks. It encapsulates the data and port address information from the application layer into segments (TCP) or datagrams (UDP). If multiple types of data are being sent to a remote location, it will multiplex this data, chopping it up and compressing it for transport with information that can be used to decompress and reassemble it at its destination. These PDUs are now ready for the Internet/Network layer.
  * At the Internet/Network layer, the PDUs from the transport layer are encapsulated into packets which include sender and receiver public IP address information. Each device has its own IP address used for routing data from one network to another, however an IP address at the LAN level is distinct from an IP address at the Internet level; these are the local IP address versus the public IP address, respectively. Public IP addresses are a finite resource, with about 4 billion available for IPv4 and many orders of magnitude more for IPv6. The public IP addresses of the sender and recipient are a part of the header used to encapsulate a segment/datagram into a packet, along with the IP version, a checksum for data verification, fragment number for reassembly, protocol (TCP/UDP), and a TTL (decreasing counter - if a packet is routed through too many bounces it will be disposed of rather than continuing to bounce and contributing to network congestion). The logical structure of an IP address includes routing information for country or broader network; once received at these areas it can be directed more specifically by network members that have knowledge of a specific address. Eventually, it will be received at an Internet gateway for the LAN of the recipient, at which point it will be received by the Data Link layer.
  * At the Data Link layer, the Internet packet will be encapsulated into a frame, which includes the sender and receiver MAC address information, as well as a way of verifying that the data is sent intact from one node of the data link to another. 
  * Once the data reaches the destination server, the Data Link frame will be decapsulated for the last time. The Internet packet will then be decapsulated for the last time. The packets that comprise the data payloads being sent will be reassembled and then de-multiplexed, and then sent to the port address for the applications necessary for the processing of the data payload.
  * Any response data now follows this same chain of events, but this time from the server to client.
  * Each level may bounce between nodes, at which the PDU for that level is decapsulated, examined, then re-encapsulated and sent to the next node.
  * Additional details may be required. For instance, if the IP address of a destination is not known, a sender will consult its local DNS server with the human-readable address to resolve the corresponding public IP address. TCP requires a handshake to ensure connection, often followed by a TLS handshake to ensure security, as well.

* Each layer encapsulates the data it handles in a protocol data unit (PDU), hiding it from the layers beneath it:

  * ![layered-system-pdu](C:\Users\cedou\Downloads\layered-system-pdu.png)

* The layers of communication are replicated between communication nodes, and each layer will undo its respective encapsulation layer for examination before either re-encapsulating it and passing it to a closer-to-address node, or vertically up/down the chain to be handled at another layer:

  * ![image-20220717180819914](C:\Users\cedou\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20220717180819914.png)

    The image above illustrates data being sent for transmission from the Application layer, which is encapsulated into a TCP segment at the Transport layer, then an IP packet at the Internet Layer, then a Frame at the Link layer.

    This is somewhat incomplete as the IP packet will spend most of its journey as such, before becoming an ethernet frame at the last leg of its journey before it is de-capsulated at each level and assembled into data for the Application layer

## Answer: Depending on which model, the layers of internet communication are (Physical - OSI), Link, Internet, Transport, Application (DoD)

-------

## Question: Physical layer: What are the bottlenecks for sending and receiving data?

## Evidence:

* Latency:
  * Transit speed. If the internet were a highway, this would be the speed limit.
* Bandwidth:
  * Transit capacity. If the internet were a highway, this would be the number of lanes.
  * How much data the transport channels are able to handle.
  * Bandwidth varies at different points of a packet's journey, and the total bandwidth available to that packet is the lowest value at any point of its journey.
* Propagation delay: The physics-gated time it takes for data to travel from one point to another. This is gated by transport medium (copper cables, fiber-optics, radio signals), their environment (impedance, refraction angle, distance/non-permeable environments), and distance.
* Transmission delay: Data makes multiple jumps between transit nodes, connected by network infrastructure. Each hop begets some amount of transit delay.
* Processing delay: When making its network hops, either intra or inter-layer, the data is processed in some way. This also incurs some amount of transit delay.
* Queuing delay: Each communication node can only process so much data at a given time. If that capacity is exceeded other data is buffered into a queue before it can be processed. During times of congestion this will also incur transit delay.
* Last-mile latency: Many of the aforementioned delays are incurred near the endpoints of communication, either between the client and ISP or server and ISP, as these endpoints have many more hops for data to take before their receipt.
* Round-trip Time (RTT): The length of time for a signal to be sent plus the amount of time for acknowledgement of receipt to be received. Communication protocols such as TCP/TLS are connection-oriented and require not only that data is sent, but that readiness for communication is acknowledged and that receipt of data is confirmed.

## Answer: Latency and bandwidth combined comprise the end-to-end communication delays for an inter-network call.

## Question: Data Link layer: What are the most important rules for transferring data and how is this implemented at the Link layer?

## Evidence:

* The most important rule for transferring data is that data needs to be correctly addressed. After all, what is the point in transferring something to the wrong place?
* The Link layer is the lowest layer at which data is encapsulated. In this case, it is encapsulated into ethernet frames: a PDU which adds originating MAC (media access control) address and  destination MAC address to the head of the unit, and a FCS (frame check sequence) to its tail. These wrap around the data payload: an IP packet from the layer above, the Internet layer. Ethernet frames are utilized for communication between devices on the same LAN.
  * Other data added to the head are length, headers (DSAP, SSAP, Control) related to the network protocol for the data payload. Addressing and integrity check are a bit more key to focus on for understanding, however.
  * MAC addresses are unique addresses hard-encoded to the NIC (network interface card) for internet-connected devices.
  * FCS is a checksum to verify that the frame has not been corrupted or interfered with from the time of encapsulation at one link node to decapsulation at another. If it is not verified as being the same frame that was sent by the originating MAC, it will be dropped and not retransmitted.
  * Lastly there is a pre-specified interframe gap: an interval during which no data is transmitted which delineates the boundary between transmitting one frame and another. A 100 Mbps gap is 0.96 microseconds/1 millionth of a second, for example.

## Answer: The most important rule for transferring data is to send it to the correct destination, followed by ensuring receipt of the correct "package." At the link layer, this is implemented with frame headers for sender and recipient, as well as a tail for data verification.

------

## Question: Data Link layer:  What is a MAC address and why is it insufficient for addressing internet packets?

## Evidence:

* MAC addresses are immutable and unique addresses that are tied to the communicating hardware: NIC cards.
* MAC addresses are great for being routed at the switch level of a LAN, however, they fail at a global scale.
* In order to route via MAC addresses, switches store a hash table of MAC addresses and their assigned IP addresses called an ARP table.
  * If there is no entry for a given MAC addresses, the switch must ask the other nodes of the LAN if they have such a MAC address, and update its ARP table once it is found prior to sending the frame to its destination.
  * This is somewhat similar to how IP addresses are utilized at a global scale, however IP addresses are logical, have a hierarchical structure, and can be reassigned. The structure of an IP address makes it easy to route in terms of vicinity.
  * MAC addresses, in comparison, are simply unique. In order to route via MAC address, a switch or router would have to access a table which contains a data container of EVERY MAC ADDRESS IT HAS EVER COMMUNICATED WITH. If it did not have a such an address, it would have to propagate a request for it across as many nodes as it took to find it. If that hard-encoded MAC address moved locations, it would have to repeat this request to update its ARP table.

## Answer: MAC addresses lack a logical structure and therefore don't scale well. They are tied to hardware and cannot be reassigned.

## Question:  Internet/Network layer: Describe the function of the Internet/Network layer .

## Evidence:

* Whereas the Data Link layer is used for node-to-node communication between members of a network, the Internet/Network layers is used for network-to-network communication. 
* Internet Protocol (IP) is the main protocol used to standardize and address internetwork communication. 
  * Segments from the Transport layer are encapsulated into IP packets, including the IP version (IPv4 vs IPv6), TTL (number of IP node bounces before discard), Fragment Offset (number used for data fragment reconstruction), Protocol (TCP, UDP), Checksum (integrity of data, IPv4 only), and Source and Destination Address.
* IP addresses are either IPv4 or IPv6.
  * IPv4 addresses are 4 sections of 8 bits each, or 0-255.0-255.0-255.0-255, allowing for about 4 billion combinations.
  * IPv6 addresses are 8 sections of 16 bit blocks, allowing for 340 * 10 ** 36 combinations (340 undecillion) combinations. The checksum layer is discarded in favor of the Data Link layer checksum. For this reason IPv6 is already necessary and supplanting IPv4.
* A ISP will have a certain number of IP addresses it covers, assigning one of these to its customers. The customers will receive internet data through this address at their gateway. 
* Within that gateway there is likely to be a LAN (local area network) with a router. The router has a routing table to transfer data among its nodes using private IP addresses. Each router will have a subnet of IP ranges it covers, and transfer to the private IP address or to another node correspondingly. 

## Answer: The Internet/Network layer encapsulates and transfers data between networks using IP addresses.
